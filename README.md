For the replication of results obtained:-
 1. Clone this repository.
 2. Open the cloned directory.
 3. Open the terminal and exeecute "pip install -r requirements.txt"
 4. Ensure that you extract the common dataset and task 6 dataset in this directory itself. Please look at the directory structure above to ensure files are placed correctly.
 5. Open the folders "task1_models" and "task2_models" and download the models from the given drive link. The drive links are present in the REAMDE.md file in the folders.
 6. The Jupyter Notebook named "common_task.ipynb" corresponds to the common task, and the one called "specific_task6.ipynb" corresponds to the specific task 6.
 7. Open the notebooks and run them. The notebook is filled with comments for explaining the approach. NOTE: If you want to perform inference only, you can just skip the cells corresponding to training loops (mentioned in the notebook as well).
